# BookDatabaseWithSortingAlgorithms
Developed a program in C++ that allows user to sort books by various attributes including title, author, year, etc. 
<small>One of the goals of this programming assignment was to gain a better understanding of different sorting algorithms as well as their various run time complexities. A simple user input interface was developed, where the user chose a sorting algorithm. A book csv file was read into the program using getlines. The program outputs the run time for the selected sorting algorithm as well as the csv file containing the book database information sorted based on that specific sorting mechanism and private attribute. Error handling was integrated to ensure that the user could not choose an option outside of 1-4.
